# Background

In macroevolution, phylogenies provide a hypothesised roadmap describing the relationships between species (or higher taxa) and the timing of their divergences. Typically we aim to infer the most complete and accurate phylogeny possible, to obtain a reliable picture of the tempo and mode of evolution in that clade. Genetic sequences have become relatively easy to obtain for living species, particularly through openly accessible databases such as [NCBI Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). While the fossil record can provide us with valuable insights into species in deeper time, we cannot obtain genetic sequences for these species, and to integrate them into phylogenies we must instead rely on their morphological characteristics. Phylogenetic approaches which combine both genetic and morphological data (and typically both extant and extinct species) are known as **total-evidence** methods {% cite Ronquist2012 Zhang2016 --file Total-Evidence-Tutorial/master-refs.bib %}. Here we will demonstrate how to infer a total-evidence phylogeny using the fossilized birth death (FBD) model in BEAST2.

# Programs used in this Exercise 

### BEAST2 - Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees 2

[BEAST2](http://www.beast2.org) is a free software package for Bayesian evolutionary analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC and strictly oriented toward inference using rooted, time-measured phylogenetic trees {% cite Bouckaert2014 --file Total-Evidence-Tutorial/master-refs.bib %}. This tutorial uses the BEAST v{{ page.beastversion }}.

### BEAUti - Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility

BEAUti2 is a graphical user interface tool for generating BEAST2 XML configuration files.

Both BEAST2 and BEAUti2 are Java programs, which means that the exact same code runs, and the interface will be the same, on all computing platforms. The screenshots used in this tutorial are taken on a Mac OS X computer; however, both programs will have the same layout and functionality on both Windows and Linux. BEAUti2 is provided as a part of the BEAST2 package so you do not need to install it separately.

### Any programmer-friendly text editor

We will need to edit the XML files produced by BEAUti, for which we'll need a text editor. It's best to use one designed for programmers as these include nice features such as syntax highlighting, which makes the code more reader-friendly. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a good option which is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux.

### Tracer

[Tracer](http://beast.community/tracer) is used to summarise the posterior estimates of the various parameters sampled by the Markov Chain. This program can be used for visual inspection and to assess convergence. It helps to quickly view median estimates and 95% highest posterior density intervals of the parameters, and calculates the effective sample sizes (ESS) of parameters. It can also be used to investigate potential parameter correlations. We will be using Tracer v{{ page.tracerversion }}.

### R / RStudio

We will be using R to analyze the outputs of our analyses. RStudio provides a user-friendly graphical user interface to R that makes it easier to edit and run scripts. (It is not necessary to use RStudio for this tutorial.)

# Practical: Total Evidence Tutorial

In this tutorial we will infer a phylogeny using a combination of both morphological and genetic data for the Osmundaceae, or "Royal Fern", family of plants. 

The aim of this tutorial is to:
- Learn how to read morphological data into BEAST2;
- Understand the differences between how BEAST2 treats morphological and genetic data;
- Practise visualising total-evidence phylogenies.

## The data

### Genetic sequences

### Morphological data

## Creating the Analysis Files with BEAUti

### Install BEAST2 packages

>Open the **BEAST2 Package Manager** by navigating to **File > Manage Packages**.
>
>Install the **BDSKY** and **feast** packages by selecting them and clicking the **Install/Upgrade** button one at a time.

### Importing the data

### Setting initial tip ages

### Priors

### Adding tip age priors

### Setting up MCMC

## Examining the results

We can now examine the results of our **fossilised-birth-death** model. Again, we need to read in the relevant log file and trim off the first 10% as burn-in.

```R
# Navigate to Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory (on RStudio)
# or change file name to the full path to the log file
#(Use "dinosaur_BDSKY_final.log" if you used our pre-cooked XML)
fbd_file <- "dinosaur_BDSKY.log"

#Read in coalescent log and trim 10% burn-in
fbd <- read.table(fbd_file, header = T) %>% slice_tail(prop = 0.9)
```
